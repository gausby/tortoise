defmodule Tortoise.Handler do
  @moduledoc """
  User defined callback module for handling connection life cycle events.

  `Tortoise.Handler` defines a behaviour which can be given to a
  `Tortoise.Connection`. This allow the user to implement
  functionality for events happening in the life cycle of the
  connection, the provided callbacks are:

    - `init/1` and `terminate/2` are called when the connection is
      started and stopped. Parts that are setup in `init/1` can be
      torn down in `terminate/2`. Notice that the connection process
      is not terminated if the connection to the broker is lost;
      `Tortoise` will attempt to reconnect, and events that should
      happen when the connection goes offline should be set up using
      the `connection/3` callback.

    - `last_will/1` is called to get a last will message for a
       new connection. If none is provided (nil), the connection's default
       last will will be used.

    - `connection/3` is called when the connection is `:up` or
      `:down`, allowing for functionality to be run when the
      connection state changes.

    - `subscription/3` is called when a topic filter subscription
      changes status, so this callback can be used to control the
      life-cycle of a subscription, allowing us to implement custom
      behavior for when the subscription is accepted, declined, as
      well as unsubscribed.

    - `handle_message/3` is run when the client receive a message on
      one of the subscribed topic filters.

  Because the callback-module will run inside the connection
  controller process, which also handles the routing of protocol
  messages (such as publish acknowledge messages) it is important that
  the callbacks do not call functions that will block the process,
  especially for clients that subscribe to topics with heavy
  traffic.

  Technically it would be possible to run the callback module in a
  different process than the controller process, but it has been
  decided to keep it on the controller as we otherwise would have to
  copy every message evaluated by the connection to another
  process. It is much better to let the end-user handle the
  dispatching to other parts of the system while we are evaluating
  what to do with the process anyways with the caveats:

     - The callbacks should not block the controller

     - it is not possible to call the (un)subscribe and publish
       functions from within a callback as they will block the
       controller.

  While it is not possible to subscribe and unsubscribe in the handler
  process using the `Tortoise.subscribe/3` and
  `Tortoise.unsubscribe/3` it is possible to make changes to the
  subscription list via `:gen_statem` inspired *next_actions*.

  ## Next actions

  In some situations one would like to subscribe or unsubscribe a
  filter topic when a certain event happens on the client. The
  functions for interacting with the MQTT broker, defined on the
  `Tortoise`-module are for the most part blocking operations, or
  require the user to peek into the process mailbox to fetch the
  result of the operation. To allow for changes in the subscriptions
  one can define a set of next actions that should happen as part of
  the return value to the `handle_message/3`, `subscription/3`, and
  `connection/3` callbacks by returning a `{:ok, state, next_actions}`
  where `next_actions` is a list of commands of:

    - `{:subscribe, topic_filter, qos: qos, timeout: 5000}` where
      `topic_filter` is a binary containing a valid MQTT topic filter,
      and `qos` is the desired quality of service (0..2). The timeout
      is the amount of time in milliseconds we are willing to wait for
      a response to the request.

    - `{:unsubscribe, topic_filter}` where `topic_filter` is a binary
      containing the name of the subscription we want to unsubscribe
      from.

  If we want to unsubscribe from the current topic when we receive a
  message on it we could write a `handle_message/3` as follows:

      def handle_message(topic, _payload, state) do
        topic = Enum.join(topic, "/")
        next_actions = [{:unsubscribe, topic}]
        {:ok, state, next_actions}
      end

  Note that the `topic` is received as a list of topic levels, and
  that the next actions has to be a list, even if there is only one
  next action; multiple actions can be given at once. Read more about
  this in the `handle_message/3` documentation.

  Invoked when messages are published to subscribed topics.

  The `topic` comes in the form of a list of binaries, making it
  possible to pattern match on the topic levels of the retrieved
  message, store the individual topic levels as variables and use it
  in the function body.

  `Payload` is a binary. MQTT 3.1.1 does not specify any format of the
  payload, so it has to be decoded and validated depending on the
  needs of the application.

  In an example where we are already subscribed to the topic filter
  `room/+/temp` and want to dispatch the received messages to a
  `Temperature` application we could set up our `handle_message` as
  such:

      def handle_message(["room", room, "temp"], payload, state) do
        :ok = Temperature.record(room, payload)
        {:ok, state}

  Notice; the `handle_message/3`-callback run inside the connection
  controller process, so for handlers that are subscribing to topics
  with heavy traffic should do as little as possible in the callback
  handler and dispatch to other parts of the application using
  non-blocking calls.

  for later invocations.
