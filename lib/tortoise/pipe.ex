defmodule Tortoise.Pipe do
  @moduledoc """
  Experimental. This feature is under development.

  The transmitter "pipe", for lack of a better word, is an opaque data
  type that can be given to a process. It contains amongst other
  things a socket.

  A process can obtain a transmitter pipe by issuing a `pipe =
  Tortoise.Pipe.new(client_id)` request, which will result in a pipe
  in passive mode, meaning it will hold a socket it can publish
  messages into, but might fail, in which case it will attempt to get
  another socket from the transmitter. This all happens behind the
  scenes, it is important though that the returned pipe is used in
  future pipe requests, so publishing on a pipe should look like this:

    pipe = Tortoise.Pipe.publish(pipe, "foo/bar", "bonjour !")

  This is all experimental, and efforts to document this better will
  be made when the design and implementation has stabilized.
